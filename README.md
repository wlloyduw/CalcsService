# CalcsService

The CalcsService is a compute-bound microservice implemented for testing Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms.  Implementations are available in Java, Node.JS, and Python.  The CalcsService integrates the [Serverless Application Analytics Framework (SAAF)](https://github.com/wlloyduw/SAAF).  The CalcsService implements random multiplication and division where the operands are stored in arrays which are then randomly selected for math operations.  Array indexes are selected randomly forcing the application to jump to read a location potential on another memory page.  Memory stress is introduced by using increasingly larger arrays.  With larger arrays we measure an increase in the number of page faults when running the calcs service.  For example using an array size of 1,000,000 vs 1 increased the observed number of page faults by 15.8x when measured using an AWS Lambda function deployed with 256MB.  With a 2048 MB function, increasing the array size from 1 to 1,000,000 produced a 13.2x increase in the number of page faults.  These page faults are then shown to result in an increased runtime on AWS Lambda of 3.9x (256MB), 3.88x (512MB), 3.55x (1024MB), and 2.24x (2048MB) respectively.  Increasing the array size also increases performance variance of the function from 11.9% -> 29.7% (256MB), 9.6% -> 25.8% (512MB), 9.2%->21.7% (1024MB), and 5.5%->24.8% (2048MB).
